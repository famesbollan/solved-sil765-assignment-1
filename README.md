You are required to develop a program to encrypt (and similarly decrypt) a 128‐bit plaintext using AES that uses keys of size 128 bit, and 10 rounds. Instead of using an available library, <strong><em>I insist that you program any and every element of each of the 10 rounds of AES</em></strong> (and that means Substitute bytes, shift‐rows, etc., generation of sub‐keys, etc.). Having done that, and for a one or more input plaintext(s), verify that indeed the output of the 1<sup>st</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> encryption round is identical to the output of the corresponding decryption rounds. (This is illustrated below).

<strong><u>Project 1</u></strong>:

You are required to develop a program to encrypt (and similarly decrypt) a 64‐bit plaintext using DES. Instead of using an available library, <strong><em>I insist that you program any and every element of each of the 16 rounds of DES</em></strong> (and that means F‐box, 32‐bit exchanges, generation of sub‐key required in each round). Having done that, with one or more 64‐bit plaintext(s), verify that indeed the output of the J<sup>th</sup> encryption round is identical to the output of the (16‐J)<sup>th</sup> decryption round. (This is illustrated below for round 16 of encryption).
